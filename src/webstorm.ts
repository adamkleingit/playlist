    Spy on me baby use ESLint
    Infrared to see me code and give me hints
    Aim gonna fire shoot me right
    You make my syntax highlight

    Now you found the messy code I use
    You make it straight, you give me clues
    So I can't deny or lie cause you're
    the only one to make me fly.

original lyrics:
Spy on me baby use satellite
Infrared to see me move through the night
Aim gonna fire shoot me right
I'm gonna like the way you fight

Now you found the secret code I use
to wash away my lonely blues
So I can't deny or lie cause you're
the only one to make me fly.

[Chorus:]
Sexbomb Sexbomb you're a Sexbomb
You can give it to me, when I need to come along
Sexbomb sexbomb you're my sexbomb
And baby you can turn me on.

No don't get me wrong ain't gonna do you no harm (no)
This bomb's for lovin' and you can shoot it far
I'm your main target come and help me ignite
Love struck holding you tight.

Make me explode although you know
the route to go to sex me slow
And yes, I must react to claims of those
who say that you are not all that.

[Chorus x2]

You can give me more and more counting up the score
You can turn me upside down and inside out
You can make me feel the real deal
And I can give it to you any time because you're mine

Sexbomb Sexbomb you're a Sexbomb
You can give it to me, when I need to be turned on

Sexbomb Sexbomb you're my Sexbomb
And baby you can turn me on. [x8]
