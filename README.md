# playlist
Merging problems? A cool framework you just discovered? The QA ruined your day again? 
Why not singing about it? 

Frontend-band is happy to present the first ever open source tech playlist - a playlist that will be all dedicated to your day to day experiences as a software developer, and that's where you step in! 

You're welcome to contribute to our playlist, and.. Who knows, maybe soon you'll hear your own words on the stage!
